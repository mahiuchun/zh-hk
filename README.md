# Chinese (HK) Helper

## Introduction
This project tries to help Chinese input in Hong Kong by providing easy-to-use
input code query.
It is NOT an authoritative reference of Chinese language itself.

## The situation of Cangjie/Quick input
Cangjie/Quick is widely available.
However Cangjie has many variants;
so-called Cangjie 3 and Cangjie 5 are just two most popular variants.

Many references do not bother to mention Cangjie variant,
they usually refer to Cangjie 3.

We provide Cangjie 5 reference also since it has notable adopters like OS X,
Chrome OS.

## The situation of Cantonese phonetic input
Cantonese readings and romanization both suffer from fragmentation issues.

We are not going to settle these issues here,
we just try to provide useful information.

Currently we just provide Jyutping readings from
[CUHK](http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/).
We also maintain a [list](wiki/CantoneseInput) of Cantonese input methods
